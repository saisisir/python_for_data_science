Python provides several arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators for performing different operations. Here are some of the basic operators:

Arithmetic operators:

Addition (+): adds two values
Subtraction (-): subtracts one value from another
Multiplication (*): multiplies two values
Division (/): divides one value by another
Modulus (%): returns the remainder of the division operation
Floor Division (//): returns the quotient of the division operation, rounded down to the nearest integer
Exponentiation (**): raises one value to the power of another
Comparison operators:

Equal to (==): checks if two values are equal
Not equal to (!=): checks if two values are not equal
Greater than (>): checks if one value is greater than another
Less than (<): checks if one value is less than another
Greater than or equal to (>=): checks if one value is greater than or equal to another
Less than or equal to (<=): checks if one value is less than or equal to another
Logical operators:

AND (and): returns True if both statements are true
OR (or): returns True if at least one statement is true
NOT (not): reverses the result of a comparison, returning False if the result is True, and vice versa.
